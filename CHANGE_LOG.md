	+ KSP v 1.2 compatibility
	+ Removed ModuleManager from the archive, since it's no longer mandatory for non-FAR installs and with FAR it will be there anyway.

		- Short video: https://youtu.be/8nDSSh-7dQw
* 2016-0625: 1.5.5 (Boris-Barboris) for KSP 1.1
	+ 2-seconds input delay for desired speed, course, altitude and vertical speed fields.
	+ additional hotkeys for speed control toggle (on\off), cruise flight vertical motion control toggle and altitude\vertical speed toggle.
	+ neo-gui by Morse (http://i.imgur.com/pMWmYuX.jpg), togglable by setting use_neo_gui in GlobalSettings.txt\AtmosphereAutopilot to true. Flag is updated every scene change, no need to restart KSP to toggle.
* 2016-0617: 1.5.4 (Boris-Barboris) for KSP 1.1
	+ fixed bug with incorrect handling of navball in surface velocity mode;
	+ Mini-AVC version files fixed;
	+ stock-alike deploy direction of control surfaces under stock aero;
	+ corrected GUI hiding (F2) code;
	+ fixed old bug with stock control surfaces, wich snapped deflection to zero on small control signals. Behaviour on extreme dynamic pressure regimes significantly improved under stock aero, for both manual and automated flight;
	+ new window in AppLauncher window list - "Hotkey manager". Allows to change hotkeys in runtime. Escape to unset hotkey (yes, it pauses the game as well, i know, i hate GUIs);

	+ close window buttons added;
	+ Cruise Flight window reworked, advanced settings hidden, distance to waypoint readout added;
	+ Cruise Flight setpoints are controllable by pitch and yaw keys if needed. Right Alt (configurable in hotkeys manager) toggles this behaviour. To toggle and tweak, adress CF window advanced options and docs;

	+ vertical speed setpoint added to Cruise Flight;
	+ added hotkeys for Rocket mode and Coordinated turn flags of FBW;
